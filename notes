Here's a list describing some of the project structure

+ blacklist.txt     filename patterns to exclude from apks built with p4a
+ .gitignore        filename patterns to exclude from git repository
+ inspect7.sh       extracts the contents of the armeabi-v7a android build
                    into inspect/v7a so that the contents of the apk can be
                    inspected; the apk must be in the project root directory
                    for this to work
+ inspect8.sh       like inspect7.sh except for use with the armeabi-v8a build
+ make-apks.sh      creates the android packages for distribution
+ main.py           acquisition entry point on linux and windows; must be run
                    with python3 and requires a full installation of kivy;
                    dist/windows provides a binary which makes it possible to
                    run acquisition on machines without proper requirements
+ specs/            dedicated location for both .spec files used with p4a
+ modules/          python source files for acquisition, except main.py
+ layouts/          .kv layout files used by kivy

Here's a list of things which might go wrong while running p4a.

+ An error that involves Java might come from using the wrong java version. See

  In particular, when I ran into this issue, davidBoertjes comment solved my
  problem.
