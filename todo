[X] when the pieces start disappearing midway through the game, the board looks kind of 'naked'. 
    there should be a setting to enable/disable 'grid', which is a small gray border around each square tile.
[X] obviously the game navigation buttons (undo, redo, reset) have not been debugged and properly implemented.
[X] consider some better color themes- one option is white background and black color for status text
[-] increase the font size of text automatically to fit the size of the label.
[X] create a global width to which the width of all UI elements (except piece_layout) are bound, and which is bound to the width of the piece_layout.
[-] add a rule to end the game when a threshold of nonstacking moves is reached.
[-] add a rule to detect when a new scoring condition cannot be reached from a given board state, and to terminate the game in this case.
[-] and a UI element to keep track of the nonstacking move count as well as the repetition move count.
[X] add a stacking sound effect and a setting to disable/enable the sound effect (with a corresponding enable/disable sound widget in the game UI).
[X] add a simple minimax search to evaluate moves so that one or both players can be replaced by a computer.
[X] consider adding new types of cylinders with color coded values (white/grey - 1; red - 5).
[X] animate computer movement.
[X] implement 'click' mode.
[X] implement game persistance. Note that a new game should _not_ save on closing except after a move has been made.
[X] modify the names of the highest difficulty rating to be 'formidable' instead of 'infuriating'.
[X] integrate David's undo, redo, and new game icons.
[X] incorporate threading into the reload process so that reloading images doesn't cause the app to hang.
[X] make multi-colored settings labels to allow the words with the most information stick out.
[X] implement game variations!
[X] BUG - moving a cylinder off the piece_map can cause the app to crash with an IndexError.
[X] implement variant persistance.
[X] BUG - computer continues making its own moves even when exiting the game screen.
    This is especially apparent when placing computer vs. computer.
[ ] A nice feature to have would be an animated repeat of the most recent move upon entering the game screen.
[X] selecting a piece, exiting before completing the move, and changing mode to "drag" causes a crash.
[ ] remove the font setting and set the font of all labels and buttons to CaviarDreams
[X] implement an option to show available moves on piece selection
[ ] currently the game autosaves on exit. consider implementing autosave on variant change as well
    EDIT - consider implementing autosave on game screen exit.
