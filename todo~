[ ] when the pieces start disappearing midway through the game, the board looks kind of 'naked'. 
    there should be a setting to enable/disable 'grid', which is a small gray border around each square tile.
[X] obviously the game navigation buttons (undo, redo, reset) have not been debugged and properly implemented.
[ ] consider some better color themes- one option is white background and black color for status text
[ ] increase the font of text automatically to fit the size of the label
[X] create a global width to which the width of all UI elements (except piece_layout) are bound, and which is bound to the width of the piece_layout.
[ ] add a rule to end the game when a threshold of nonstacking moves is reached.
[ ] add a rule to detect when a new scoring condition cannot be reached from a given board state, and to terminate the game in this case.
[ ] and a UI element to keep track of the nonstacking move count as well as the repetition move count.
[X] add a stacking sound effect and a setting to disable/enable the sound effect (with a corresponding enable/disable sound widget in the game UI)
[X] add a simple minimax search to evaluate moves so that one or both players can be replaced by a computer.
[ ] consider adding new types of cylinders with color coded values (white/grey - 1; red - 5)
[ ] animate computer movement
[ ] implement 'click' mode
[ ] implement game persistance. Note that a new game should _not_ save on closing except after a move has been made.
